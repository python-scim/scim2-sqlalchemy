Discuss
-------

A feature or a bugfix starts with a discussion on the
`bugtracker <https://github.com/python-scim/scim2-sqlalchemy/issues>`_.

Unit tests
----------

Run ``uv run pytest`` before submitting a patch. Run ``uv run tox`` to test every supported
Python version. Everything must pass before a patch can be merged.

The tests run on SQLite. To run them on PostgreSQL too, give the URL of a database the tests may
empty in the ``SCIM2_SQLALCHEMY_POSTGRESQL_URL`` environment variable:

.. code-block:: console

   $ SCIM2_SQLALCHEMY_POSTGRESQL_URL=postgresql+psycopg://localhost/scim uv run pytest

The test coverage threshold is 100%. Check it with
``uv run pytest --cov --cov-fail-under=100 --cov-report=html``. The report is written to
``htmlcov``.

Code style
----------

The project uses `ruff <https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/>`_ and other checks through
`prek <https://github.com/j178/prek>`_. Run ``uv run prek run --all-files`` before submitting a
patch. Install the hooks with ``uv run prek install`` to run them before each commit.

Documentation
-------------

Build every page from scratch, with warnings treated as errors:

.. code-block:: console

   $ uv run --group doc sphinx-build -E -W --keep-going --builder html doc build/sphinx/html

The generated documentation is located at ``build/sphinx/html``. The examples of the
documentation run with the unit tests.
